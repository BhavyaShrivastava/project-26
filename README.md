
   What is Pav Bhaji

Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai and hugely popular all over India as a street food. It originated in Mumbai as a quick lunch option for textile mill workers.

Gradually this dish becomes so popular that now it is served as street food as well as in restaurants in Mumbai and the rest of India.

In Hindi and Marathi languages, the word “Pav” is for bread rolls. “Bhaji” means vegetables or a vegetable based dish (dry or gravy) in the Marathi language. Since both the bhaji (vegetable gravy) and pav (dinner rolls) are served together, hence the name ‘Pav Bhaji‘.

It is basically a mix of mashed and spiced vegetables in a tangy flavorful spiced gravy. A special spice blend called ‘Pav Bhaji Masala‘ is used to make this dish. Pav bhaji masala powder is easily available in Indian stores and online but can be made at home too.

Keep in mind that the best taste of the bhaji comes from using the perfect and best pav bhaji masala. I highly recommend to include your favorite brand or make your own homemade pav bhaji masala.
